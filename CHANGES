0.14 - 29/09/2009

        *Used net_mac_uuid in audit.vbs instead of uuid_type. Fixed so it takes
         uuid_type as the named argument
        *audit.pl was using argument 'non_ie_url' instead of 'non_ie_page' when
         calling audit.vbs, this has been fixed
        *audit.pl was using argument 'software' instead of 'software_audit' when
         calling audit.vbs, this has been fixed *sigh*
        *Copy-paste error for named arg software_audit in audit.vbs modification
        *audit.pl logs if an audit doesn't post corectly to admin_add_pc_2.php
        *When doing Windows audits you can specify the UUID type (mac,name,uuid)
        *Modified open_audit.sql so it creates tables during setup
        *Modified upgrade.php so it creates tables if someone is upgrading
        *Revamped the audit_command.php page to use the same logic that adding
         a mysql query on the config page uses.
        *Removed cron_log_level field, as I never ended up using it for what I
         inteded to
        *Running the script as a service on Windows is now optional. If not
         checked, the script will launch as a separate process via the start
         command. This makes the install process for linux and windows pretty
         much the same. It also makes it possible to run the service using just
         the audit.pl file and not audit.exe
        *audit.pl mysql logging functions now escape characters that would other-
         wise cause issues with logging
        *Added smarter logging of commands run against computers. Checks the exit
         status and logs which commands exited correctly or not
        *The config/schedule tables on audit_manage.php now clear as expected when
         they are all deleted and are replaced with a link to the page to re-add one
        *corrected the path for the search.php patch

0.13 - 24/09/2009

        *Modified audit.vbs to accept command line arguments. Audit.pl passes 
         parameters without needing an audit.config to be on a network share
        *Can enable/disable software audits for Windows audits and change the
         url Windows audits are sent to through the web interface
        *Fixed spelling error on audit_configuration.php (LDAP Paging Size)
        *Removed argument when calling GetAesKey, as it is not needed anymore
        *Audit.pl no longer relies on a PID file for linux daemon usage
        *Init script not needed for audit.pl linux daemon usage anymore
        *The status of the Web-Schedule service is checked by using the PID
         written to the OA DB and verified using audit.pl --check-pid
        *Adjusted CSS for cron entry test on audit_schedule.php to force image 
         size for ajax image
        *Audit.pl checks the default install location for Nmap, in addition to
         the path.
        *Adjusted various code formatting.

        *--run-config option wasn't set to a string after changing it. Whoops!

0.11 - 18/09/2009

        *Fixed the path for custom headers for emails in audit.pl
